        <p style="padding: 0 15%">I think that time is very valuable as it is a limited resource. Regarding this I don't make static prices as someone on Fiverr would. Instead I am calculating the price of the software after it is done. Don't worry I will not ask for money if there is no finished product in the end. But I will ask if it was recognised as usable from the buyer.</p>
        <hr/>
        <h3 class="text-center">But how do I calculate my prices then?</h3>
        <p style="padding: 0 15%">Obviously hourly. I will track the time I have spent on developing the plugin. I will take the minimum wage of my country <b>13â‚¬</b>h.1 <br /> Of course, if the product is not too large, static prices can be considered.</p>
